## Program 1 
### Fernndo Gonzalez
### Description:

This Program creates a proper fraction class that will overload the +, -, *, /, and == operators. Although I write classes 1inline during lecture, I prefer (or mandate ... whatever makes you feel better) a class definition along with a class implementation where the definition has no variable names or implementation and the implementation is done outside of the definition using the scope resolution operator :: to bind methods to the Fraction class. We will also discuss the need for public and private methods.
